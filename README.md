# CSCI4250-HCI-Project

Milestone 1
- For Milestone 1, we created a lofi prototype on a whiteboard at the UNO Library. We drew out our collective ideas for what the app should look like, and wrote descriptions on what each functionality is and should do. 

Milestone 2
- For Milestone 2, we created an animated prototype vdeo that shows the simulated functionality of our app. The video goes through each function and shows the expected output.

Milestone 3
- For Milestone 3, we recorded a short video which showed what was working at the start of our development process. We went through and functions we implemented and showed what they do or are expected to do. We also wrote a usability testing plan which describes how we planned to test our application. 

Milestone 4
- For Milestone 4, we wrote up the reflection, usability report, linked the implementation, and recorded the video demonstration.
